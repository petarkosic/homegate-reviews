## Welcome to the Homegate Apartment Reviews

Homegate Apartment Reviews is a conceptual project created to showcase the potential of a comprehensive apartment reviews application. It's designed to help individuals make informed decisions when searching for their dream apartment.

It's important to clarify that this app is a **proof of concept** and **DOES NOT** have any real-world implications or intentions of infringing on others data.

## Key Features

1. **Apartment Listings**: The app provides a glimpse into how real-time apartment data can be displayed. However, it is essential to note that the data is sourced solely for illustrative purposes and does not constitute actual listings.
   <br/>

2. **AI-Generated Reviews**: The reviews you see on this platform are generated by artificial intelligence to showcase the concept of user reviews. They are entirely fictional and not based on any real user experiences.
   <br/>

3. **Limited Apartment Availability**: To maintain a controlled environment, we've intentionally limited the available apartments for review to a predefined set of 10.
   <br/>

4. **User Accounts**: The app includes a set of 30 fake user accounts tied to the fake reviews. While you can log in as one of these users to leave reviews, there is no functionality to register new users.

## Disclaimer

1. **Data Sources**: The apartment data, including rent price, living space, location, number of rooms, description, features, availability and images, is obtained from a publicly available website and is used only for the purpose of demonstrating the capabilities of this application. No data is copied or stored beyond this demonstration, and it does not constitute real listings.
   <br/>

2. **Privacy**: No personal data or information is collected from users of this application.
   <br/>
3. **Intent**: The sole purpose of this app is to showcase my technical skills as a developer and does not intend to deceive or misuse data in any way.

## Requirements

- Node js 16.+ (https://nodejs.org)
- PostgreSQL 13.+ (https://www.postgresql.org/)

## How to run

Make sure the postgresql service is running.

```
git clone https://github.com/petarkosic/homegate-reviews
cd /homegate-reviews
cd /server
npm install

cd ..
cd client
npm install
```

Inside `/server` create a `.env` file.

```
PORT=<app_port> (default = 5000)
SALT=<hash_salt_rounds> (recommended  = 10)

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<long_secret_string>

CREATE_DB_USER=<db_user> (default = postgres)
CREATE_DB_PASSWORD=<db_password>
CREATE_DB_HOST=<db_host> (default = localhost)
CREATE_DB_PORT=<db_port> (default = 5432)
CREATE_DB_DATABASE=postgres (default = postgres)

DB_USER=<db_user> (default = postgres)
DB_PASSWORD=<db_password>
DB_HOST=<db_host> (default = localhost)
DB_PORT=<db_port> (default = 5432)
DB_DATABASE=<db_database> (default = homegate_reviews)
```

---

**IMPORTANT**:
Database values with a prefix `CREATE_` are used to login to the default database and create a new database that the app uses.

Database values without a prefix are used to create tables and seed all the data.

---

To create the database and seed the data, inside `/server` folder run:

```
npm run seed:db
```

To start the application, inside `/server` folder run:

```
npm run dev
```

This script concurrently starts both client side and server side.

Default port for client side is **3000**. (http://127.0.0.1:3000/)
